      <p>This game guides you through the life of an unnamed woman from her history, childhood and adulthood.
      Which parts of her story and which version of events will come to fruition depend on what you decide. </p>

      <p>The character the player inhabits mirrors the notions we as a society hold for death.
        That it is a living being who will inevitably visit us all, regardless of our wishes.</p>

      <p>Sound is also featured at certain parts on the game. When you see this button you'll know this feature is available at this part of the game. </p>
      <button>Play</button>

      <p>By pressing it you can play accompanying sound effects/music.</p>

      <p>I wanted this game to feel like opening up a book and stepping into the pages, seeing all the events as if they are happening right in front of you.</p>

      <p>I hope you enjoy and thank you for playing.</p>
