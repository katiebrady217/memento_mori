    <p>Her Grandfather holds himself with the army dictated control he’s held his whole life. This military mindset was passed down from each and every generation of his family. He was taught to be ruled by logic and practicality.
      The only emotion he could ever really command was the love he held for his wife. And even that has faded to a chill since his so-called Granddaughter was left at their door.
    </p>

    <p>He clicks his fingers and the young girl scrambles to her feet. He stalks toward the stairs intending to ensure she enters and stays in her room for the night.
      He doesn’t glance back to know she follows him. A man like her Grandfather is used to being obeyed in all things even if orders aren’t verbalised you’re likely to be punished twice over for not having the ability to mind read.
      He begins to march up the stairs with the girl following until he hears an intake of breath. Where his Granddaughter’s heel slipped on the loose carpet train and she’s about to lose her balance.
