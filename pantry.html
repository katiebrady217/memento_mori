    <p>Sent on an errand by the cook the Maid enters the pantry lined with ingredients from the gardens, flour from town and all manner of spices and sweets brought up from London that she never thought she would know the names of.
      The Maid gazed wide-eyed before remembering her task. Not finding what she needed she decided to make her way out to the gardens to ask one of the kitchen boys for help before admitting her defeat. That’s when she noticed the dark figure who’d slipped in behind her.</p>

    <p>”You’re new,” he said in a casual voice as if they had simply met in the crowded hall instead of being cornered in the cupboard. The Master of the house still had the boyish good looks of his teens yet there were obvious signs creeping in around his eyes and mouth of the devastating man he would become.
      The kind of man who could make a good, honest girl abandon what she worked hard for in the hopes he might fulfil his intoxicating promises. You feel the urge, guiding the man’s hand to the handle of the pantry door.
