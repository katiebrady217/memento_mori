      <p>This young couple so blissfully in love. Memories yet to be made yet in the back of their minds as they dance with wild abandon in front of their friends, their family. Everyone believing they shall have all the time in the world. As if the the old miser of the clocks would pause the swinging of the pendulum simply because they insisted. </p>

      <p>That however is not how life works. </p>

      <p>It is not how Death works either.</p>

      <p>The Lord and his Lady their eyes shining full of their first moments together. How the Lord knew from those terse, biting words she uttered to him about his conduct. He knew there would no one else in the world for him. How the Lady learned despite his brusqueness, his arrogance he was simply a man who needed to be shown that love was selfless. It was not a tool for politicking or monetary gain as he’d grown up believing.
      </p>

      <p>Black cloth sweeps around your legs as you stride to the centre of the ballroom. A winter wind chills each guest you pass. You come to where they stand in each others arms, the waltz at an end.
        Bone white hand extended, you curl your fingers around the Lady’s shoulder, frost forming on her collarbone.</p>

      <p>And the Lady stops breathing.</p>

      <p><b>THE END</b></p>
