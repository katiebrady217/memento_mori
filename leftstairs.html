    <p>Your first step onto the dust covered board echoes throughout the great hall, bouncing off the rafters. The atmosphere stutters, the few candles lining the opposite way gutter out and it seems as if the house held its breath at your decision.
      You continue on up into the dark recesses of the upper west wing. A wide hallway stretches further than even your eyes can make out, you walk on into the house’s oppressive darkness.
      The house settles, creaks around you. It didn’t expect you <b>here</b>.</p>

    <p>Two doors await you once you finally reach the end of the darkness, strong flickers of firelight edge out from under the door in front of you. You press your ear against the smooth surface a hollow shaking cough can be heard.
       Muffled but unmistakeable in its death rattle.To your left the strings of a quartet can be heard, a waltz is playing.</p>
