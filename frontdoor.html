    <p>You grasp the heavy golden handle, it is warm to the touch despite the bite of frost that lingers in the air from a winter that refuses to release its grip just yet.
      The door creaks open at the slightest push.
    </p>

    <p>It knows to let you in. That the time has come
      You feel the bitter chill rush through the grand entry hall up the staircase. Your hand trails up the sweeping bannisters until they curve off at the landing.
      Great stained glass windows flood the space with blue tinted moonlight. Two flights branch off to the left and right. The left is covered in a thick layer of dust, untouched for months.
      More likely years. The steps to the right are lit with soft glowing sconces, beckoning you up with warm candlelight. A luxury not seen in any other corner of the house.
