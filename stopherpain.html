    <p>Each and every night she screams. Is it the house? Is it the darkness she can sense around her origins? Her Grandfather never looks at her except as he would a bug under his shoe. Her Grandmother feels the guilt threaten to overwhelm every thought.
      What? What could she have changed? Loved her son more? Loved her son differently? Nothing she has done these past seven years have felt right. What had she done wrong?</p>

    <p>Surely it was something. All her time with this child in her house and yet she does not speak. She can hear her husband coming down his stairs. She misses him too. Misses when each and every time he looked at her he was happy. In this single moment of selfishness she wanted that back most of all. The child is still screaming. You want as the choice clicks into place behind her eyes. The pillow in her hands quiets the childâ€™s screams. After 5 minutes everything in the entire world seems so deadly quiet.
