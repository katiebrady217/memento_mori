    <p>Everything in her granddaughter’s seven years of life have been hard. Not knowing her mother or father, not ever knowing true comfort in the only home she knows and neither of the adults looking after her have an inkling of what t do.
       Not a word has been uttered by her despite the doctor’s visits facilitated by her Grandmother. She simply won’t articulate the pain her young soul feels day after day and each night it manifests in her dreams.</p>

    <p>She falls, falls, falls into deep dark nothing. This time she wakes before hitting the bottom, her throat raw but this time instead of morning light filtering in  to wake her she is being rocked. The long arms of her Grandmother encircle her torso, her head buried in her neck and she breathes in her Grandmother’s still lingering rose perfume. “Thank you,” her small voice whispers.
