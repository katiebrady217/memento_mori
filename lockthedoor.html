    <p>The lock turns. They’re completely alone.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Nine months later we return to the house dark and empty. The Master has been missing ever since his spectacular disappearance during his homecoming party.
      Rumours of gambling dens and dismal taverns have lined the gossip rags for these long months but his parents still have nothing tangible to know where their son is.
      No note, no requests for money. One particular heart stopping piece of gossip spoke of a hurried marriage licence obtained through his godfather but still no confirmation.</p>

    <p>The bell sounds through the stifling summer air. Dusk settled hours ago but the heat shows no signs of abating tonight. The staff question whether to answer it but the Lady of the house rarely sleeps now hoping to see her son once more.
        On pulling open the grand front door a basket lies on the steps. Seemingly full of soft, white wool until she hears the small mewling cries a newborn. Pulling back the blanket a baby’s face is revealing with a piece of paper tucked on their chest which reads
        “Care for her. She deserves better than both of us.” The child’s eyes open and the Lady of the house finds herself looking into her son’s eyes once more.

      <p><b>THE END</b></p>
