    <p>The house seems to echo a quiet sigh as you climb the illuminated steps. As you step onto the wide gallery a lithe woman in a sweeping dress breezes past. The world is expected to fall at her feet from the way she carries herself and there seems to be no objection from the crowd of would be suitors lining the hall, people treating in the scent of
      Champagne and luxury while thick columns of pipe smoke eke out of the billiard room and the jazz band plays on in the hall.</p>

    <p>The Lady in red casts her eye to take in the assembled company, she misses the eyes of a young lad she’d insulted in the garden upon arrival for his clumsy manners towards his attending valet. He was a Lord, had been since his 18th year and his surprise at her biting words had grown into an insatiable curiosity for her. However she had no thoughts of the man who could grow to love her as his own. Money is still the greatest fickle motivator here and in the Lady’s mind was intrinsically tied to her survival. </p>

    <p>Marry for money and not love and she could escape the fate that her mother never had the chance to. Slick black shoes and bright polished buttons marked Mr. Ingot out as the richest man at this party. The ring he’d placed on the Lady’s finger in the pavilion just after dinner also made everyone  of the society gossips sure that he would protect the investment he’d just made in his future bride as ruthlessly as he executed all his deals. Mr Ingot leads her by the elbow down into the dark of the hall away from the light of the party and the eyes of the man who could love her.
