    <main class="storytext">

    <p>This old powerful structure looms tall and imposing imprinted against the night sky.
      It seems as deeply rooted as the oak trees that surrounds it. These centuries old guardians bow toward the manor as a mother would protecting her newborn babe.
      Shielding it from those who wish to harm. Who wish to disturb whatever hollow, forged peace was created in this ancient space.
      Yet the house itself stood long before the trees were seeds thrown by the wind.
    </p>

    <p>You could still turn back here.</p>

    <p>You can feel the shift in the air as you press your advance towards it.
        The manor taunts you like a cruel older brother, daring you to take the next few steps, leaning into that feeling of dread.
        One foot in front of another until your toes brush the front door step.
    </p>
