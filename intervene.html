    <p>As we’ve said the girl’s Grandfather has always had a mind full of sound logic.
      He knew his social and political standpoint had taken a significant downturn thanks to his foolish son’s part in bringing this unwanted child into the world.
      He wished for himself and his wife to share the same mind once again but their son was where their own inclinations had never met.</p>

    <p>Was it better for him to follow the cold strict upbringing his own father had subjected him to or was being smothered in his mother’s affection the better choice.
      Their parenting choices were only things that could be rectified in their imaginations and with the benefit of hindsight. The actions and many mistakes of his son could not be changed.
      And that wasn’t his Granddaughter’s fault.</p>

    <p>His reflexes allowed him to catch the little girl’s hand pulling her in until her face was buried in the fabric of his smoking jacket.
      He holds her to him for a long time remembering what it was like in those early months of fatherhood when he was the only one who could get his boy to settle and sleep.
      “I’m sorry,” he whispers, his voice choked with tears “I’m so sorry.”
