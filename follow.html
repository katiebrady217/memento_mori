    <p>As evidenced through all similar stories in history neither were happy on this path. Marriage was a business deal to both parties but Mr Ingot’s rabid protection he held for all his possessions no doubt extended to his wife. A woman who’d once thought money was the key to her protection in this world now knew it made up the prison walls that she’d built around herself. The Lady who once held the command and attention of all who laid eyes on her wasted away under constant admonishments and threats from the man who would now never let her free. </p>

    <p>This is the woman now sat in front of you. Hunched and defeated, the finest clothes money can buy hand off her frame lifelessly. You can simply watch. In this there is no action that need be taken. The green pills in her hand one moment simply slip down her throat the next. </p>

    <p>Is this the last grab for the power she once wielded in her youth. To make the decision herself before her life is enviably snatched by her husband? Or another? Her eyes drift close. The Lady stops breathing.

      <p><b>THE END</b></p>
