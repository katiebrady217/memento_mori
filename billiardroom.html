    <p>The thick mahogany door to your right is now all but silent bar the cracking of the burning log. The Lady stands in front of you again years have past and none of them went by without a single jab, kick or punch to her. The sapphire studded evening gown now almost swallows her tiny frame but the glint of knowing sparks in her eye.
      She’s made her decision and no natural force in the known universe will stop that now.</p>

    <p>A tumbler is half filled with her husband’s favourite liquor and a quarter filled with powder from her prescription sleeping pills. She had been told the dose would be enough to incapacitate a male gorilla she imagined it would be sufficient to do away a middle aged banker who smoked like a chimney. You watch from behind his desk as he crashes in, the bookshelves quaking from the force of his slamming the door. The Lady watches unperturbed as he send the glass flying toward her head. The smash litters the floor with shining broken pieces of crystal that catch and throw the firelight across the Lady’s face.</p>

    <p>She watches the shadows dance as Mr. Ingot fall to his knees, his complexion turning an unnatural puce. For he never was one to waste a drink. And so she walks out leaving you to wonder who really is meant to master the art of death here?
    </p>

    <p><b>THE END</b></p>
