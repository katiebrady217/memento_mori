    <p>The Old Lady gazes at this child with the same wonder that filled her eyes the seven years prior when she was found in the basket. Nothing but a soft knitted blanket over her and a carefully scrawled note “Care for her. She deserves better than both of us.” She beckons to her that it’s time to sleep. They climb the stairs to the old nursery,
      the little girl almost swinging from Grandmother’s tall frame. She drags the knitted blanket behind her still. </p>

    <p>The woman watches over the girls until her breaths become deep and even, sleep making her features akin to the small baby she once was. The Grandmother shuffles back to her chambers across the hall. Thinking of all that has happened in the space of seven years. Not enough for a life time but plenty for a life that was built over 60 years to change irrevocably, for her husband to become distant and cold, for her son… This house used to brim with life. Parties, the romance, music and champagne. She orchestrated it all but one tiny life that began on her doorstep one July night ended that forever</p>

    <p>The child is screaming. Nightmares hound the child every sleeping hour she finds. The child’s voice echo through the halls sure to reach her Grandfather’s chambers. Hurrying from bed her Grandmother stands by her bedside.
