    <p>Stepping over this threshold you sense exception hanging heavily in the air. You were expected days ago weeks even but the woman on the bed in front of you doesn’t show anger in the lines that now mark her face. Each one sculpted by a memory, a moment; a tear, laughter the frown that always let her husband know he was in trouble for something he had no prior knowledge of. Her face had been lit by a life all these years not a fairytale one where everything came easy and good triumphed in the end. But it was a life fulfilled.</p>

    <p>She’d lost her husband years back but his memories of her had faded slowly which was more painful for her than watching them drop the first scoop of soil onto his coffin. You approach a bedside with a sense of certainty your job isn’t to act on justice or on the balance of whether the time before life is extinguished is sufficient. This, however, is as easy as it gets. You curl your fingers around the limp hand laying on the bedspread. And the Lady stops breathing.
